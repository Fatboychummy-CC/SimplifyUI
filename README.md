# SimplifyUI

## Heavy work in progress currently, a lot of work is needed.

### What is this?

This is going to be a GUI system for ComputerCraft that will be similar to Roblox's GUI system, with some features pulled from Core's GUI system for ease-of-use.

### How long until this is done?

I'm looking into getting a timeline for this, but I'm still drafting the main bulk of it. I've got some good ideas though, and I am hoping to have it finished within a month or two.

### Examples?

Soon:tm:
